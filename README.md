## Technical Details

### Backend Technology

* Node.js & Express: Used to build a RESTful API and serve static frontend files.
* FileSystem (fs): Used to persist recipe data in a local `recipes.json` file.

### External API Integration

* API Used: [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com/)
* Transformation: The backend consumes the raw "advice" data, filters it, and transforms the object structure into a custom `dailyTip` format before sending it to the frontend. This ensures the frontend never communicates directly with third-party services.

### Frontend Technology

* Vanilla JavaScript: Handles DOM manipulation, asynchronous fetch requests, and local filtering.
* CSS3: Custom styles using CSS variables for a consistent theme.

## Submission Credentials

* External API: Publicly available (No API Key required).
* Database: Local JSON storage (Reset by clearing `recipes.json` to `[]`).
